## Active Threads

| Thread | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Branch + worktree setup | Done 2026-10-20 | Created from `main` at `805f9738`, pushed to `origin/presentations`; symlinks + `npm install` done; Step 0 passes in the worktree. Each session: `/restart`, then `git merge main`. |
| Teacher review of example decks | Blocked: waiting on teaching staff | 4 examples in `handoff_bundle_2026-09-29/presentation_examples_deferred/` (Bio L2, Chem L4, Maths L4, Physics L2). Generator design waits on this feedback. |
| Presentation HANDOFF + initiation prompt | Not started | To be written once the review feedback is in. |
| Output commit policy | Decision pending (Mark) | ~1 GB per grade if committed; precedent: revised corpus is gitignored and shared via Drive. |
